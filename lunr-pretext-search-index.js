  "body": " Introduction  Numerous definitions of statistics are given, and each description implies that data are collected, with inference as the objective. Each requires selecting a subset of a large collection of data, either existent or conceptual, in order to infer the characteristics of the complete set. All the authors imply that statistics is a theory of information, with inference making as its objective .  The large body of data that is the target of our interest is called the population , and the subset selected from it is a sample Information useful in inferring some characteristic of a population (either existent or conceptual) is purchased in a specified quantity and results in an inference (estimation or decision) with an associated degree of goodness     For each of the following situations, identify the population of interest, the inferential objective, and how you might go about collecting a sample.   The National Highway Safety Council wants to estimate the proportion of automobile tires with unsafe tread among all tires manufactured by a specific company during the current production year.   The population of interest is all tires manufactured by a specific company during the current production year, the inferential objective is to estimate the proportion of tires with unsafe tread among the population, and a sample could be collected by taking measurements at the specific tire manufacturer.   A political scientist wants to determine whether a majority of adult residents of a state favor a unicameral legislature.   The population of interest is adult residents of a state, the inferential objective is to determine how high the proportion of adult residents in the state who favor a unicameral legislature is, and a sample could be collected by polling adult residents in the state.   A medical scientist wants to estimate the average length of time until the recurrence of a certain disease.   The population of interest is people who have had a certain disease, the inferential objective is estimating the average length of time until the disease recurs in someone who has had it before, and a sample could be collected by consulting a database of medical records for people who have experienced the disease.   An electrical engineer wants to determine whether the average length of life of transistors of a certain type is greater than 500 hours.   The population of interest is transistors of a certain type, the inferential objective is determining whether that type of transistor has an average lifespan of more than 500 hours, and a sample could be collected by by measuring how long each transistor in a sample of transistors of that type lasts for.   A university researcher wants to estimate the proportion of U.S. citizens from \"Generation X\" who are interested in starting their own businesses.   The population of interest is U.S. citizens from Generation X, the inferential objective is to determine the proportion of U.S. citzen Gen X-ers who are interesting in starting their own businesses, and a sample could be collected by polling U.S. citizen Gen X-ers.

  "body": " Characterizing a Set of Measurements: Graphical Methods  An individual population (or any set of measurements) can be characterized by a relative frequency distribution , which can be represented by a relative frequency histogram . A graph is constructed by subdividing the axis of measurement into intervals of equal width. A rectangle is constructed over each interval, such that the height of the rectangle is proportional to the fraction of the total number of measurements falling in each cell Although they are arbitrary, a few guidelines can be very helpful in selecting the intervals. Points of subdivision of the axis of measurement should be chosen so that it is impossible for a measurement to fall on a point of division Using many intervals with a small amount of data results in little summarization and presents a picture very similar to that data in their original form. The larger the amount of data, the greater the number of included intervals can be while still presenting a satisfactory picture of the data. We suggest spanning the range of the data with from 5 to 20 intervals and using the larger number of intervals for larger quantities of data .  "

  "body": " Finding the Probability Distribution of a Function of Random Variables  We will present three methods for finding the probability distribution for a function of random variables and a fourth method for finding the joint distribution of several functions of random variables. Any one of these may be employed to find the distribution of a given function of the variables, but one of the methods usually leads to a simpler derivation than the others. The method that works best varies from one application to another. The fourth method is presented in . Although the first three methods will be discussed separately in the next three sections, a brief summary of each of these methods is provided here.   Consider random variables and a function , denoted simply as . Then three of the methods for finding the probability distribution of are as follows:  1. The method of distribution functions: This method is typically used when the 's have continuous distributions. First, find the distribution function for , , by using the methods that we discussed in . To do so, we must find the region in the space for which and then find by integrating over this region. The density function for is then obtained by differentiating the distribution function, . A detailed account of this procedure will be presented in .  2. The method of transformations: If we are given the density function of a random variable , the method of transformations results in a general expression for the density of for an increasing or decreasing function . Then if and have a bivariate distribution, we can use the univariate result explained earlier to find the joint density of and . By intergrating over , we find the marginal probability density function of , which is our objective. This method will be illustrated in .  3. The method of moment-generating functions: This method is based on a uniqueness theorem, , which states that, if two random variables have identical moment-generating functions, the two random variable possess the same probability distributions. To use this method, we must find the moment-generating function for and compare it with the moment-generating functions for the common discrete and continuous random variables derived in Chapters 3 and 4 . If it is identical to one of these moment-generating functions, the probability distribution of can be identified because of the uniqueness theorem.
