  <p> A measure of the goodness of an estimate is the <em>error of estimation,</em>
  the difference between the estimate and the parameter estimated 
  (for example, the difference between <m>\overline{y}</m> and <m>\mu</m>). </p>

  <p>
    We will assume throughout the remainder of this text that populations are large in comparison to the sample size
    and consequently that the random variables obtained through a random sample are in fact independent of one another.
