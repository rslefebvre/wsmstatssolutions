  <p>
    Numerous definitions of statistics are given, and each description implies that data are collected, with inference as the objective.
    Each requires selecting a subset of a large collection of data, either existent or conceptual, in order to infer the characteristics of the complete set.
    All the authors imply that <em>statistics is a theory of information, with inference making as its objective</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The large body of data that is the target of our interest is called the <term>population</term>, and the subset selected from it is a <term>sample</term><ellipsis></ellipsis>
    Information useful in inferring some characteristic of a population (either existent or conceptual) is purchased in a specified quantity and results in an inference (estimation or decision) with an associated <term>degree of goodness</term><ellipsis></ellipsis>

      <introduction>
        <p>
          For each of the following situations, identify the population of interest, the inferential objective, and how you might go about collecting a sample.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The National Highway Safety Council wants to estimate the proportion of automobile tires with unsafe tread among all tires manufactured by a specific company during the current production year.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The population of interest is all tires manufactured by a specific company during the current production year,
            the inferential objective is to estimate the proportion of tires with unsafe tread among the population,
            and a sample could be collected by taking measurements at the specific tire manufacturer.
          </p>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A political scientist wants to determine whether a majority of adult residents of a state favor a unicameral legislature.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The population of interest is adult residents of a state,
            the inferential objective is to determine how high the proportion of adult residents in the state who favor a unicameral legislature is,
            and a sample could be collected by polling adult residents in the state.
          </p>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A medical scientist wants to estimate the average length of time until the recurrence of a certain disease.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The population of interest is people who have had a certain disease,
            the inferential objective is estimating the average length of time until the disease recurs in someone who has had it before,
            and a sample could be collected by consulting a database of medical records for people who have experienced the disease.
          </p>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            An electrical engineer wants to determine whether the average length of life of transistors of a certain type is greater than 500 hours.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The population of interest is transistors of a certain type,
            the inferential objective is determining whether that type of transistor has an average lifespan of more than 500 hours,
            and a sample could be collected by by measuring how long each transistor in a sample of transistors of that type lasts for.

        <statement>
          <p>
            A university researcher wants to estimate the proportion of U.S. citizens from "Generation X" who are interested in starting their own businesses.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The population of interest is U.S. citizens from Generation X,
            the inferential objective is to determine the proportion of U.S. citzen Gen X-ers who are interesting in starting their own businesses,
            and a sample could be collected by polling U.S. citizen Gen X-ers.

        <statement>
          <p>
            For more than a century, normal body temperature for humans has been accepted to be 98.6<degree></degree> Fahrenheit.
            Is it really? Researchers want to estimate the average temperature of healthy adults in the United States.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The population of interest is healthy adults in the United States,
            the inferential objective is estimating the average temperature of health adults in the United States,
            and a sample could be collected by measuring the temperature of a sample of healthy adults in the United States.
