  <p>
    Numerous definitions of statistics are given, and each description implies that data are collected, with inference as the objective.
    Each requires selecting a subset of a large collection of data, either existent or conceptual, in order to infer the characteristics of the complete set.
    All the authors imply that <em>statistics is a theory of information, with inference making as its objective</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The large body of data that is the target of our interest is called the <term>population</term>, and the subset selected from it is a <term>sample</term><ellipsis></ellipsis>
    Information useful in inferring some characteristic of a population (either existent or conceptual) is purchased in a specified quantity and results in an inference (estimation or decision) with an associated <term>degree of goodness</term><ellipsis></ellipsis>

      <introduction>
        <p>
          For each of the following situations, identify the population of interest, the inferential objective, and how you might go about collecting a sample.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The National Highway Safety Council wants to estimate the proportion of automobile tires with unsafe tread among all tires manufactured by a specific company during the current production year.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The population of interest is all tires manufactured by a specific company during the current production year,
            the inferential objective is to estimate the proportion of tires with unsafe tread among the population,
            and a sample could be collected by taking measurements at the specific tire manufacturer.
